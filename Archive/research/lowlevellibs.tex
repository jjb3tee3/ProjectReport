\subsubsection{LORCON}
LORCON is an open source networking tool used for monitoring and injecting IEEE 802.11 frames [1] that emerged as a result of a talk in 2002 that put forward and discussed the issues current tools had with code duplication due to implementing their own methods of packet capture and injection, and lack of support for drivers that werenâ€™t included in the tool [2]. It has bindings available in Ruby (ruby-lorcon) and Python (PyLorcon2) that are useful for rapid prototyping and testing wireless chipsets to determine whether they are compatible.
