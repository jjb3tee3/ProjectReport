\begin{abstract}
This report studies how insecurites in the 802.11 standard are being capitalized on by public bodies to monitor and profile users. A honeypot application is created that masquerades as a device's previously connected network, discovered through broadcast probe requests. This application is coupled with an Android game that leaks data to demonstrate how traffic can be monitored once a device is ensnared. It was found that Android devices in particular are unrelenting in broadcasting probe requests, leaving them vulnerable to this attack. Reccomendations are set out toward protecting against this attack at application level.
