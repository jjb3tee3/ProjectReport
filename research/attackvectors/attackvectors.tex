\subsection{Attack Vectors}
\label{sec:attacks}
There are a number of attacks that take advantage of insecurities in the 802.11 standard and that capitalize on unencrypted or WEP encrypted networks.  Where the attacks are demonstrated, they were performed using a laptop running BackTrack running in a virtual machine, with an Alfa wireless adaptor.

The attacks that I have documented all lend themselves to the overall application I am trying to implement, either by complimenting or directly using tools, applications and principles that will come in use.
