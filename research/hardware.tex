\subsection{Hardware}
The selection of hardware for usage in this product comes down to a combination of two vendors. Firstly the wireless adaptor manufacturer, such as Edimax, Netgear, Belkin, etc. that build the overall product. The decision of which manufacturer in this respect is not as important as the second, the chipset manufacturer.  These are companies such as Broadcom and Realtek, and this decision determines which operating systems are compatible, the device driver to use, and ultimately whether injection and monitoring are supported.

\subsubsection{Wireless Adaptor}
This boils down to device type, i.e. whether the adaptor is PCI, USB, etc.
\subsubsection{Wireless Chipsets}
Consideration has to be taken into the chipset wireless adaptors use for compatibility with injection and monitoring libraries. Certain vendors, such as RealTek, support the open source community more-so than others which means drivers can be written for adaptors that use them.

Firstly I tried to use a wireless adaptor purchased for use with the Raspberry Pi. The Edimax EW-7811UN fulfilled the first part of the criteria by using the RTL8188CUS chipset as working drivers were available for Linux, and it
