\subsection{Operating Systems}
There are two ideal Linux distributions that have been developed with the purpose of being used for network penetration testing and have various applications and tools pre-installed to take advantage of WiFi vulnerabilities. One of these distributions also has a version compiled for ARM that will allow the software to run on embedded platforms, with little porting, such as the IGEP V2 and cheaper alternatives, the Beagleboard and Raspberry Pi.

 I have tested each of the distributions, firstly to determine whether the Air-ng applications would install and run, as if they wouldnâ€™t it was almost a guarantee that programs written using Lorcon would not work correctly, then once it was determined these would run, I tested a couple of wireless adaptors by setting up a soft AP, bridging this the actual hard AP, and forwarding traffic through it, using the Air-ng suite, as this would produce a similar effect to the final application.

\subsubsection{Backtrack 5 R3}
Backtrack was a security distribution that focused digital forensics and penetration testing. It comes pre-installed with a whole host of applications and tools, and was bootable from Live CD and USB. 

This distribution comes with the Air-ng applications pre-installed, which was a good guarantee that any attempts to use libraries based on libpcap will meet little resistance from install.

Backtrack is unfortunately no longer supported; however, a branch- Kali Linux- has been developed and is actively updated.
\subsubsection{Kali}
Kali marked the switch from an Ubuntu base to Debian for the Backtrack developers. One of the big updates from Backtrack is further support for ARM devices, which means it can be run on the Raspberry Pi. This is a huge benefit as it would reduce any effort in porting the application to an OS running on the board.
