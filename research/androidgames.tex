\subsection{Android Game Programming}
As this is my first foray into game programming for Android the easiest solution would be to find a library that could handle the game engine functions, making it easier and quicker to develop as the game portion is not a integral part of the project.

\subsubsection{libgdx}
libGDX provides the perfect solution to my problem. It offers a cross-platform, open source solution to creating 2D and 3D games for Android, iOS, Windows/Mac/Linux desktop, web and others [2]. Alongside this Badlogic [5] provides a simple tool [4] for creating projects that can be imported into Eclipse [3] which is detailed in the implementation section of this report.

There are numerous tutorials that detail the process of writing games for Android using libgdx, and a specific one that creates a Flappy Bird [8][9] clone called Zombie Bird [6] by Kilobolt [7], from which a large proportion of knowledge was gained in terms of game and class design. They allow usage of assets free of charge to projects, and as such some of the images will be reused in Leaky Bird to speed up the development process.
